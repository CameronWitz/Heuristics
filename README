This Repository contains implementations of heuristics to solve certain optimization problems. 

SavingsAlgorithm2.py - This file implements several variations of the savings algorithm for route determination. This was a prompted 
question from the Northwestern course IEMS 381, and all code was written by myself. The algorithm is detailed well through comments
in the code. It ranges from implementations of the standard savings algorithm, to the savings algorithm with randomness to find a more 
optimal solution, and finally an implementation that offers 2-edge optimization to further enhance the final solution. 

NetworkVisualization.py - This file is used to visualize the graphs created by the SavingsAlgorithm2.py script. It is used to showcase
the final solution realized from solving the problem instances provided by the course.
